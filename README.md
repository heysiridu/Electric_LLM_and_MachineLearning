# DataAnalyticsProject

### In 2024 Fall, I enrolled in the Analytics in Action class at Columbia Business School. I worked with a real company in this class to solve its problems in a team of five. Electric is a Series D startup founded in 2016. The company provides comprehensive IT support to over 1,000 clients and handles over 44,000 monthly IT tickets. It spends around 1.32 million per month on human agents to solve these tickets. Our project is to help Electric reduce this cost by designing a prediction model. The model will classify requests and determine whether they are automatable based on the first few messages. As a result, we designed a 2-option user interface mockup, reached an 80-90% accuracy range and saved $2 million annually.
